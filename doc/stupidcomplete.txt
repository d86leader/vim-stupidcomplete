*stupidcomplete.txt*    A small indent-based usercomplete function for vim

Works just like any-word completion, except it's dumb and ignores words that
are not on a correct identaion level.

For example, when stationed on line 4 it will complete with aaa, bbb, ddd and
fff but not ccc and eee in this scenario:
>	aaa
>	   bbb
>		  ccc
>	   ddd
>		  eee
>	fff

                                                    *stupidcomplete-options*
Use *stupidcomplete_word_regex* to set which characters are recognised as part
of word. This can be set either as global or buffer, with buffer option taking
precedence. By default it is set to the following value:
>	let g:stupidcomplete_word_regex = '\m[A-Za-z0-9_]'
